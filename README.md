Text-Based Adventure Game
Welcome to the Text-Based Adventure Game! This is a basic example of a C++ program that simulates a simple interactive story where the player makes choices to navigate through different paths and outcomes.

How to Play
Compile: Use a C++ compiler to compile the code (main.cpp).
Run: Execute the compiled program.
Follow Instructions: Read the story prompts and make choices using the provided options.
Outcome: The story will unfold based on your choices, leading to different outcomes.
Features
Input/Output: The program uses the cin and cout functions for input and output.
Choices: You'll make decisions by entering numbers that correspond to your choices.
Paths: The story has two paths to choose from, each with its own set of choices and outcomes.
Messages: The program displays descriptive messages to guide you through the story.
Conclusion: The game concludes with a message based on your choices.

Text-Based Adventure Game is a console application and is designed to be 
interactive and entertaining. It features a variety of locations, objects, and NPCs 
with which the player can interact. The main goal of this project is to practice 
Design Patterns, C++, and basic game development using OOPS. Most of the 
implementation of this game is based on the principles of Object-oriented C++.
